# Presentations
> By James Riordan for the echo2016 Cambridge DyNaMo project

This repository contains a multi-linear set of presentations built using the
[DyNaMo](https://github.com/echocam/DynamicNarrative) toolset. The presentations
were given on the 2nd March 2016 at the Wiliam Gates Buidling in the computer
lab by Angus Hammond, Robin McFarland, Tom Read Cutting, James Riordan, Tim
Ringland, Angus Hammond and Elise Xue. There are two presentations:

1. A fun demonstration where the path taken depends on audience interaction.
2. An explenation of the tools, where the direction taken depends on audience
   interaction.

Feel free to investigate them to find out more about what DyNaMo does and how it
works! To run the presentations, clone this repository and as long as you have
Java 8.0_74 or above installed:
